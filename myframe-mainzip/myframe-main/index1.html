                 <p>Hard Work Beats Talent When Talent Doesn't Work Hard" After going through the rigorous admissions process, I am happy to announce that I am shortlisted for FunctionUp's Lithium batch, starting 19th September , which received 20,000+ applications! <br>When I applied at FunctionUp, little did I know about the tech industry and the perks it has to offer. I was welcomed by some great mentors, and was given a thorough insight into the nitty-gritties of being a software developer. I am excited to start my career with FunctionUp and work on industry-grade projects lined up for the coming 4 months.
